# React-Native
This will contain code sample for  learning react native

# By NPM

npm install -g expo-cli
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start


# By YARN

yarn global add expo-cli
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
yarn start # you can also use: expo start


Sometimes NPM does create some issues with react-native so i prefer with YARN.
